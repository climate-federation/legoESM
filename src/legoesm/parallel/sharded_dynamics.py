"""Sharded dynamics for multi-GPU/TPU cubed-sphere simulations.

Uses ``jax.experimental.shard_map`` to partition cubed-sphere faces across
devices, with explicit halo exchange at partition boundaries.

Design overview
---------------
The cubed-sphere has 6 faces, each carrying an (n, n) or (n, n, nlev)
grid.  On a multi-device system the natural decomposition is:

1. **Face sharding** (<=6 devices): assign one or more faces per device.
   Each device computes the dynamics for its assigned faces, and halo
   exchange (ghost-zone fill from neighbor faces) happens as a
   ``jax.lax.ppermute``-like collective inside shard_map.

2. **Sub-face tiling** (>6 devices): each face is further split into
   a (tx x ty) tile grid, giving up to 6*tx*ty devices.  Halo exchange
   happens both between tiles on the same face and across face boundaries.

Both modes are handled transparently by the functions in this module.

Usage
-----

    This function is designed to run *inside* a ``shard_map`` body where

    It uses ``jax.lax.ppermute`` to send boundary strips to neighbors

    face.  The inter-face connectivity is encoded in the permutation

    Returns a JIT-compiled function that:

    1. Distributes the state across devices (face sharding for

    2. Runs the dynamics step on each device's partition.  Because all

    3. Returns the updated sharded state.

    Parameters
    ----------

        A dynamics model with a ``.step(state, dt)`` method.  Typically

    -----
    The key insight for cubed-sphere parallelism: JAX's ``jit`` with
    ``NamedSharding`` already performs SPMD execution — each device
    computes only its shard.  Operators like ``pad_halo`` that access
    data from other faces trigger automatic cross-device communication
    (via XLA's HLO collective ops) when the data is sharded across
    devices.

    For face-only sharding (<=6 devices), this is sufficient.  The
    cubed-sphere halo exchange in ``grids/halo.py`` reads from all 6
    faces, so XLA inserts the necessary all-gather or permute ops.

    For sub-face tiling (>6 devices), additional tile-boundary
    exchange is needed; this is handled by the tiled halo backend.

    """Integrate using ``jax.lax.scan`` for XLA fusion and differentiation.

    This provides a fully JIT-compiled, differentiable integration loop.
    No intermediate states are saved (use ``sharded_integrate`` with
    ``save_every`` for that).

    The entire loop is compiled as a single XLA program, enabling
    fusion across time steps and efficient reverse-mode differentiation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    model
        Dynamics model with ``.step()`` method.
    state
        Initial state (will be sharded if not already).
    n_steps : int
        Number of time steps.
    dt : float
        Time step [seconds].
    config : DeviceConfig
        Device configuration.

    Returns
    -------
    final_state : pytree
        Final state (sharded).
