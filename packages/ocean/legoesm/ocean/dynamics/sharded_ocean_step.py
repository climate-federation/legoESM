"""Multi-GPU SPMD step for the lat-lon C-grid ocean (latlon / tripole).

Wraps ``LatLonCGridOceanModel.step`` in ``jax.shard_map`` over a 1-D ``"lat"``
device mesh, so the ocean state is partitioned by latitude band across devices
(eORCA025 ¼° needs ~141 GiB — fits 32 GiB GPUs at N>=5 bands). The dynamics
operators are element-wise / local-stencil and the in-step halo exchange routes
through the SPMD band body once ``activate_latlon_spmd_halo(mesh)`` is armed; the
barotropic PCG reductions already dispatch to ``batch_psum_spmd`` on ``"lat"``
(``barotropic_common._global_dot_batch``). This is the ocean analogue of the
cubed-sphere ``parallel.sharded_dynamics.make_sharded_step``.

Correctness is gated by ``tests/parallel/test_latlon_ocean_spmd_step.py`` (N-step
tol-match vs the single-device step). Pure-dynamics (no host-loop coupling): the
OMIP host post-step updates (ice / SSS-restore / geothermal) are NOT inside this
wrapper — they need separate gather/scatter or jax-porting (see
[[omip-multinode-spmd-scope]]).

# handle the staggered v-row (n_lat+1), the bipolar-fold localization (the
# northernmost band keeps the active ``fold``; interior bands get
# ``fold_j=cap_j=-1`` so the pad_ns_* operators fall through to the band halo
# instead of folding their own last row), AND keep ``total_area`` GLOBAL (the
# area-weighted-mean denominator must not become band-local).  Build a band
# layout with ``make_latlon_band_layout(rank, n_dev, n_lat, n_lon, fold)`` then
# call ``slice_cgrid_geometry_to_band(geom, layout)`` (curvilinear tripole /
# eORCA025) or ``slice_latlon_grid_to_band(grid, layout)`` (regular lat-lon ½°).
# latlon_mpi defers its ``from mpi4py import MPI`` to function scope, so these
# pure slicers import without requiring mpi4py.  See omip-multinode-spmd-scope.

    Field metadata is not a leaf). ``dt`` is captured in the closure (not a
    sharded argument). ``check_rep=False`` because the band halo intentionally
    reads neighbour-rank data (replication-unaware).
