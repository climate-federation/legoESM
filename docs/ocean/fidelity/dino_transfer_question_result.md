# DINO transfer question — T3 certified, T2 FE stabilization block

Date: 2026-08-30. Session:
`01a053d4-8e9f-7212-bbdb-19ba2d64e140`.

T3 is **TRANSFER_CONFIRMED**. T2 is
**BLOCKED-NEEDS-FE-STABILIZATION** and has no science verdict. The corrected
forward-Euler arms still become numerically unstable during their second model
day, before writing an admitted artifact. This result binds the T3 artifacts,
both T2 rerun failures, the unmasked CPU diagnosis, and the stop disposition.
No GPU, NEMO, or MPI process was launched while diagnosing or binding these
results.

## T3 — catalog construction is certified

The public `nemo_dino_kamm_mlf_v1` recipe and the oracle
`nemo_dino_kamm_mlf` card resolve identically. The config-identity artifact is
`/tmp/dino-transfer-01a053d4/t3/config_identity.json`, SHA-256
`cae74e17dd2e3c60f592c203b398a9d1d15790532be1387090ad9dc35fdd27fe`.
It reports `verdict=PASS`, zero identity-difference rows, a fired one-ULP
`config.asselin_gamma` plant, a fired `outer_integrator` ownership-collision
plant, and a nonempty `nemo_dino_v1` negative control.

`OWNERSHIP_COLLISION=FIRED` is the planted negative control, not a live
collision. The JSON has no live `ownership_collisions` row and records
`ownership_collision_plant={field: outer_integrator, fired: true}`. A live
collision would have made `verdict=PASS` impossible.

The five-day behavioral artifact is
`/tmp/dino-transfer-01a053d4/t3/behavior_identity.json`, SHA-256
`f52990b76afe44cc5a045fd3d2d8e7c10c311a79838bc83296fd6b873cf28169`.
It reports `verdict=PASS`, `bit_differences=[]`, no missing or extra keys,
equal normalized run configs, all required construction receipts present, and
49 compared keys. The oracle artifact SHA-256 is
`d94fd2370413c151723a9986df046d9a5d1051202802b34de2f21b7f9e725f52`;
the catalog artifact SHA-256 is
`fa778f3ed225955cf0f2ae9ac523d48b07b5763840d05fb7d7387726b65c8983`.

Therefore the catalog-built model is bit-identical to the oracle-card model
under the registered bridge and five-day behavioral check. This transfers
construction-path identity for the certified MLF card. It does not extend the
round-94 bridge claim to a standalone start or another card.

## T2 r2 — exact crash and owner

Both corrected `nemo_dino_kamm` climate arms stopped before writing an
artifact. Their logs are
`/tmp/dino-transfer-01a053d4-t2r/logs/fe_climate_r2_a.log`, SHA-256
`e07de38ab808ce86d46ba813b488b3c4661c9bed9b5627eeb5479685971db664`,
and `fe_climate_r2_b.log`, SHA-256
`637b769cba5c81dd6f3080d22ad3322e64d29bb65be6bc986258a23a80ce4452`.
Each stamps the intended FE admission bundle: `outer_integrator=forward_euler`,
`barotropic_diffusion_alpha=0.01`, and the generic Nbb/Kaa selectors. Each
reports day 1 with `|eta|max=525.7945 m` before the asynchronous Equinox check
surfaces `raw-mesh e3w_int must contain only finite values > 0`.

The committed CPU reproducer is
`scripts/validate/ocean_fidelity/dino_1226/fe_stability_repro.py`, SHA-256
`d8d8be9e0d2b057260dcebdd9a3c77c370d16005a26cf3b0f26864ee68289fae`.
It ran from clean producer `fb46fe02f0e0a9ce7414966b57c375ae9402c673`
with CPU, fp64, `JAX_DISABLE_JIT=1`, the same restart, ladder, bridges,
seasonal forcing, and no selector override. Its JSON receipt is
`/tmp/t2-fe-r2-cpu-repro.json`, SHA-256
`3adc8ba20f26dec0631b7118c5f881abd3f630391c808067ccf7725435a5281e`;
the complete log SHA-256 is
`24d0c63f2208a476d70e011587a341de00e6964a57b638a84d332042b0d0489b`.

The replay completes steps 1--10, so the former five-step control did not
exercise the failing window. `|eta|max` is `0.825653 m` at step 1,
`0.834720 m` at step 10, `10.389009 m` at step 22, `684.484519 m` at step 29,
and `525.794486 m` at step 32, exactly matching the GPU day-1 SSH maximum.
Velocity then reaches `|u|max=214.312787 m s-1` at step 35. Step 36 raises the
unmasked exact exception:

```text
equinox._errors.EquinoxTracetimeError:
raw-mesh e3w_int must contain only finite values > 0
```

The immediate raise owner is
`compute_buoyancy_frequency_nemo_bn2` (`eos.py`) called by
`compute_nemo_native_slopes` in the GM/Redi live-QCO geometry path. That check
is behaving correctly and is downstream: the permanent-FE trajectory has
already developed hundreds of metres of SSH and order-100 m/s velocity. The
upstream owner is therefore the forward-Euler/split-explicit integration of
the admitted Kamm sibling bundle. These data do not isolate which remaining
FE/barotropic composition choice causes the unstable mode, so another selector
patch is not licensed.

The earlier statement that alpha `0.01` "keeps FE stable" is **retracted**.
It only keeps five steps bounded and delays the same failure. The MLF-only
Nbb/Kaa guards and the FE alpha restoration remain valid admission/scope
fences, but they are not an FE stability fix.

## T2 disposition

T2 is **BLOCKED-NEEDS-FE-STABILIZATION**. It is not `CONFIRMED`, `REFUTED` by
the registered climate statistics, or science-scored: no climate, wall, or
score artifact exists. The 360-day and five-day GPU blocks are withdrawn from
the handoff and must not be relaunched from this producer. A future FE-specific
round must diagnose and preregister the unstable free-surface/barotropic
composition, demonstrate stability beyond this step-36 horizon with a control
that can fail, and only then reissue the frozen twin battery.

This is already a real transfer-scope finding: the certified MLF configuration
does not transfer to a runnable forward-Euler sibling under the currently
admitted faithful defaults. T3 remains complete, and T1's standalone build
round can proceed independently.

## Block-0 admission correction

The first rerun stopped in
`TestSurfaceTendencyPlacement::test_retention_synthetic_violation_both_directions`
before either registered retention assertion. The production surface-placement
path had not regressed, and none of the T2 card fences caused the exception.
The synthetic ten-column fixture inherits the faithful MLF card but has no raw
bridged NEMO `e3t_0`; commit `d1cf21b425` later promoted
`gm_redi_flux_face_thickness_evaluation="nemo_qco_live"` without adding the
matching generic fixture override. The resulting exception was
`redi_flux_face_thickness_evaluation='nemo_qco_live' requires raw NEMO e3t_0`.

The test setup now pins
`gm_redi_flux_face_thickness_evaluation="tpoint_jacobian"`, paired with its
existing synthetic-grid slope and QCO overrides. Production code is unchanged.
The isolated test passes and still executes both original plants:
`applied_now` must retain below `0.6`, while `leapfrog_rhs` must retain above
`0.6`. The complete Block-0 admission suite passes `178/178` after this
fixture repair. That admission result never licensed a long-horizon FE
stability claim.
